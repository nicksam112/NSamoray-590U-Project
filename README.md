590U Project

## Android

The Android portion of this project consists of three seperate parts, a map viewer, a bluetooth data collector, and a sound classifier. The goal of this project was to give users a broad overview of potential "hot spots" in their area, so they can better plan their routes and locations throughout the day in order to minimize their contact with these areas. All data is kept anonymous, with no user id's or bluetooth devices ever tracked or stored in order to mitigate concerns about privacy. 

#### Map Viewer
The Map View allows the user to view the collected data in their area through a handful of different methods. The primary ones are the heatmap and the marker methods. The heatmap provides a broad overview of which areas contain user collected data, and is weighted heavier in areas with larger amounts of detected bluetooth devices. The Marker view on the other hand, shows the raw collected data by users in the form of markers, one marker per data point. Users are able to click on each marker to see when that data was collected, and the number of devices that were detected.
